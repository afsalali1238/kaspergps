Next: **B**

## Notes for the next steps
- **D:** exclude `app/**` from the unit-coverage denominator (`vitest.config.ts`), so Wave 2 can render screens in unit tests without failing the 85% floor (Agent A request #1).
- **H:** put Settings Deactivate/Reactivate behind `ConfirmDialog` (today one click acts). Fix `reports.none_available` ("for the current phase") and the "Voided" duplicated in the certificate detail modal (needs a `voided_at` key). Keep `billingTabs()` and `aria-current`.
- **B:** restyle the certificate Actions cell with tokens.
